You'll see.

You'll come to realize that they're fallable humans like the rest of us.

You'll find that they will do things that you think are terrible and wrong.

You'll disassociate yourself from them and have trouble empathazing.

You'll begin to understand why so few seem to have compassion and why there is so much suffering.

You'll realize that the great banner you're fighting under is just another bullshit organization controlled by funding.

You'll understand how idealistic you were and come to accept that we just need to look out for ourselves.

You'll cling to the hope that you just haven't found the right path to approach the worlds issues. You won't though.

You'll come back.

No I won't.
