### Doomed From The Start

I told myself I wouldn't write anything until I got the offer. It's such a pain
in the ass to spend a couple of nights putting together the beginnings of a
blog and watch it go unused. It probably doesn't help that I for some reason
assumed that things would move faster. Everyone knows that life moves at a crawl
when you are waiting and warps into light speed the second you have a deadline.

So here I am. Same job, same life, same springy 5 year old Ikea mattress. The
motions and routine of life magically morphs from a comforting regimen into a
maddening prison the second you feel you are on the cusp of a life change.

If you came here for anything useful, you must be lost. This is the part of the
internet that doesn't bring any use to the world. At least for this post in
particular. It's not for lack of content.  It's more the fact that this is the
dumping grounds for the garbage that piles up in my brain over the months.

Jordan, Syria, refugees, defining well being as "jobs", humanitarian tech, NGOs
Arabic, open source, motorcycles, theft. Those will be covered after the first
post. More likely than not they will be doomed to the draft section but let's
at least try to be optimistic. I haven't even written the first post.
