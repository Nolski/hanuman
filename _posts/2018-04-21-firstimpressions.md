## First Impressions

_Cover photo thanks to the nice view outside of my IRC Temp housing :)_

First impressions are everything. I knew all of my expectations would be turned
on their head the second I arrived here and that is certainly the case of what
happened. You'd think that would help make me feel more at ease but the reality
of the situation is a bit different. 

I was up last night thinking about [Blue Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone). 
One of the most standout attributes you'll see within is the strong connection
to family. Now I don't necessarily think that spending time with your parents
is the key to living a long life, but I do think the kind of internal stress
that is avoided by having a strong social support network is a key factor into
prolonging your life. 

After moving to cities where I don't really know anyone I can really _feel_ the
difference too. I think it's most apparent here though. Being 6000 miles from
the nearest person I can call friend is something that in my head doesn't seem
like that big of a deal but in my gut is something that definitely matters.

Who wants to live passed 80 anyways.

Okay enough about me being homesick or whatever. 

#### Amman

So Amman is definitely a whole other world. There are certainly parts of it
that are very western on the surface. The entire country in the western side of
the city is fairly fluent in English. More so than most European countries that
I've visited. It's not quite Barcelona but it's not far from it either.

That's not to say that every time I try to speak Arabic I don't feel like a
total fool (despite that, everyone is very nice about it), but hopefully some
classes will help out in terms of letting me be able to get around a bit
better.

##### Demographics

In terms of population, if I had to ballpark what I've seen, it seems like
roughly a third of Jordan's population is foreign. I'd imagine a huge chunk of
these are refugees from Palestine, Syria, and Yemen. Especially in the airport
I'd say roughly half of the passports I saw at the airport visa station were
Yemeni.

##### Food & Drink

The food here is pretty decent. Most of the places I've visited have been clean
as well. There's plenty of bars and such but Shmeisani has fairly little in the
ways of either.

##### Weather

Weather here is amazing. I should probably purchase sun screen but for some
reason I feel really self concious about it. 

##### Cost

Amman is _EXPENSIVE_. I mean, housing can be on par with parts of London. Food
here is not that cheap. Comparatively to NYC it'd be cheap but given the lack
of public infrastructure, seeing prices not too far off from many Euro
countries is worrying. Speaking to some locals, many of those worries are
echoed by them as well. Income does not match cost of living here.

I suspect this is due to the amount of investment made by international banks
and them wanting Jordan to make good on all of those loans. Sure Jordan didn't
really choose to have two armed conflicts on each of it's borders or the
genocide happening in Yemen to it's South but the banks are clearly beginning
to squeeze Jordan for repayment and because of that prices here are rising.

All in all, things here aren't too bad. It'll take time for me to really
figure out how things work here and what is really going on but for now, I'm
going to get ready for bed and work tomorrow.
